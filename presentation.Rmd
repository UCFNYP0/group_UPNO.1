???
- In view of the social, economic and environmental damage caused by the urban heat island effect.
- International policies in recent years have begun to focus on the **reducing the heat island effect and establishing a warning system**.

# 1.3 Policy overview

## New York policys

**[OneNYC 2050 Volume 7 (2019)ðŸ”—](https://onenyc.cityofnewyork.us/strategies/a-livable-climate/)**
- Goal: **A LIVABLE CLIMATE.**
- INITIATIVE 21: New York City is making changes to its physical environment to promote resiliency and mitigate the most dangerous and destructive climate impacts. Such as wetland and forest restoration, to stabilize shorelines, reduce erosion, act as carbon sinks, and **mitigate urban heat island effects**.

**[Securing Our Future: Strategies for New York City in the Fight Against Climate Change (2020)ðŸ”—](https://council.nyc.gov/data/securing-our-future/)**
- Goal: **Achieve cooling equity and reduce heat-related deaths.**
- Key strategy: **Increase cooling assistance for vulnerable populations**.

**[Cool Neighborhoods NYC (2017)ðŸ”—](https://www.preventionweb.net/publication/cool-neighborhoods-nyc-comprehensive-approach-keep-communities-safe-extreme-heat)**
- Cool Neighborhoods NYC **Monitoring Strategies: Collecting Innovative Data** to Deliver Inclusive and Health-focused Climate Policy.

???
- In response to these internationalp policies,
- New York has developed **a number of strategies and tactics** to reduce the heat island effect and Fight Against Climate Change.p- **Like increasing shade, greenery cover. Addressing challenges through data collection and monitoring system.**

# 1.5 International approach examples

## Assessment of the UHI effect

The most common assessment of the SUHI uses satellite platforms to measure the **land surface temperature (LST)** (Bechtel et al.,2019).

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[UK]
- **City**: London

- **Data**: A five-year (2016-2020) time series of satellite-derived 100 m daytime LST images.

- **Approach**: After estimating the 2016-2020, average, summertime, daytime LST is to aggregate them to city block level. In addition to the average LST (avgLST), the avgLST standard deviation, minimum and maximum for each city block are also estimated.

- **Source**: Major Summer Heat Spots using Landsat-8 Thermal Satellite data.
]


.panel[.panel-name[India]
- **City**: Jaipur

- **Data**: Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data.

- **Approach**: Analysis of land surface temperature (LST) data shows that significant SUHI growth exists over the study area.

- **Source**: Investigating spatio-temporal surface urban heat island growth over Jaipur city using geospatial techniques.

]


.panel[.panel-name[Morocco]
- **City**: Casablanca

- **Data**: A time series of Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI-TIRS images and nocturnal MODIS images.

- **Approach**: In order to better analyze intense heat produced by urban core, SUHI intensity (SUHII) was computed by quantifying the difference of land surface temperature (LST) between urban and rural areas.

- **Source**: Effects of Urbanization and Seasonal Cycle on the Surface Urban Heat Island Patterns in the Coastal Growing Cities: A Case Study of Casablanca, Morocco.

]

.panel[.panel-name[China]
- **City**: Shijiazhuang

- **Data**: Landsat TM images on the mesoscale level and airborne hyperspectral thermal images on the microscale level.

- **Approach**: Land surface temperature (LST) was retrieved from four scenes of Landsat TM data in the summer days to analyze the thermal spatial patterns and intensity of surface UHI (SUHI).

- **Source**: Analysis of the Urban Heat Island Effect in Shijiazhuang, China Using Satellite and Airborne Data.

???
- The most common assessment of the SUHI uses satellite platforms to measure the land surface temperature (LST).
- satellite data like landsat8 provides can be used for **mapping the spatial distribution of urban surface temperatures and identifying urban hotspots.**
