### 1.1 Learn About Urban Heat Islands

<h3>What are Heat Islands?</h3>

Urban areas, where these structures are highly concentrated and greenery is limited, become ‚Äúislands‚Äù of higher temperatures relative to outlying areas. These pockets of heat are referred to as ‚Äúheat islands.‚Äù

<h3>Social impacts</h3>
Heat is the NO.1 weather-related killer in the US (NOAA, 2016). Every year, NYC experiences an average of 450 heat-related emergency department visits, 150 heat-related hospital admissions, and 13 heat-stroke deaths. The City also averages about 115 excess deaths from natural causes exacerbated by extreme heat annually (Matte et. all, 2016).

### 1.5 International approach examples

#### Assessment of the UHI effect

The most common assessment of the SUHI uses satellite platforms to measure the **land surface temperature (LST)** (Bechtel et al.,2019).

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[UK]
- **City**: London

- **Data**: A five-year (2016-2020) time series of satellite-derived 100 m daytime LST images.

- **Approach**: After estimating the 2016-2020, average, summertime, daytime LST is to aggregate them to city block level. In addition to the average LST (avgLST), the avgLST standard deviation, minimum and maximum for each city block are also estimated.

- **Source**: Major Summer Heat Spots using Landsat-8 Thermal Satellite data.
]


.panel[.panel-name[India]
- **City**: Jaipur

- **Data**: Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data.

- **Approach**: Analysis of land surface temperature (LST) data shows that significant SUHI growth exists over the study area.

- **Source**: Investigating spatio-temporal surface urban heat island growth over Jaipur city using geospatial techniques.

]


.panel[.panel-name[Morocco]
- **City**: Casablanca

- **Data**: A time series of Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI-TIRS images and nocturnal MODIS images.

- **Approach**: In order to better analyze intense heat produced by urban core, SUHI intensity (SUHII) was computed by quantifying the difference of land surface temperature (LST) between urban and rural areas.

- **Source**: Effects of Urbanization and Seasonal Cycle on the Surface Urban Heat Island Patterns in the Coastal Growing Cities: A Case Study of Casablanca, Morocco.

]

.panel[.panel-name[China]
- **City**: Shijiazhuang

- **Data**: Landsat TM images on the mesoscale level and airborne hyperspectral thermal images on the microscale level.

- **Approach**: Land surface temperature (LST) was retrieved from four scenes of Landsat TM data in the summer days to analyze the thermal spatial patterns and intensity of surface UHI (SUHI).

- **Source**: Analysis of the Urban Heat Island Effect in Shijiazhuang, China Using Satellite and Airborne Data.

???
- The most common assessment of the SUHI uses satellite platforms to measure the land surface temperature (LST).
- satellite data like landsat8 provides can be used for **mapping the spatial distribution of urban surface temperatures and identifying urban hotspots.**

### 3.1 Possible risks and strtegies

#### The influence of local features such as building density and height on the accuracy of detection and prediction 
In addition to remote sensing data, real-time temperature detection devices are deployed in urban spaces to improve data accuracy.  
#### The accuracy of the warning information to the public and conflicts with the existing government notification system.
When communicating thermal risks, it is essential to streamline the language, clarify the distinction between different warning levels, and ensure the accuracy of the information. 
#### Websites and apps have high operating costs in the later stages and may exceed the budget.
Establishing a sound budget and resource management mechanism, including budget planning, resource allocation, cost control and other aspects, is necessary. At the same time, effective monitoring mechanisms must ensure that budgets and resources are used wisely.

### 4 Summary
- UHI is identified using highly accurate remote sensing data. 

- Try to build a digital information platform to achieve common urban thermal data.

- Build an app on the residential side to realise the communication of people's livelihood data. 

- Future expectations: Based on websites and the app, more people's livelihood projects in the city will be carried out. 

- Disadvantages: The accuracy and frequency of updating urban thermal data need further optimisation.
